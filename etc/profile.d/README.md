MESA_NO_ERROR=1 disables error checking and reduces CPU usage, compiling mesa with flto can cause crashes with MESA_NO_ERROR=1 if so, set to MESA_NO_ERROR=0

mesa_glthread=true can cause issues with some applications (black screen), if so, it can be set to mesa_glthread=false

You can set the OpenGL, OpenGL shader library and OpenGL ES versions with these environment variables

MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=2.1

MESA_GLES_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.0

MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=120

Mesa is set to sync the FPS to the monitors refresh rate (this saves some CPU cycles, less GPU heat/power consumption, longer lifespan of the GPU at the cost of some graphical input lag which is very minor)
vblank_mode=3

you can set this to vblank_mode=0 to disable frame capping.

TCP_NODELAY, TCP_QUICKACK, TCP_CORK are TCP socket options.

TCP_NODELAY=1 disables nagles algorithm, which affects latency.

TCP_CORK=0 disables TCP socket corking, which also affects latency.

TCP_QUICKACK=1 enables quickacks, which is better for latency.

Set TCP_NODELAY=0, TCP_CORK=1, TCP_QUICKACK=0 for throughput optimization at the cost of latency.
